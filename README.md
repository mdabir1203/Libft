# First Project from the Core Curriculum of 42 Wolfsburg !!

## Description: 
            Recreating and reproducing the behaviours of function from Standard C library 
## Any kind of update / helping me optimize my code is welcomed !!             

## To run and create the library 
        ``` make all

## Output for my Makefile without using Echo as multiline comment

## To compile the function with your main run this after doing the previous step
            ```make ft_*.c libft.a
           
## I have duplicated version in my Code with my Own Written Main Function during Evaluation -->> To clean it out add this in makefile(Becareful though):
            ``` remove: 
                      rm -rf *copy.c 
                .PHONY: remove
After adding the rule run ```make remove. ``` After that run make


--------->>>>>>>> If you have suggestions how to optimize them any kind of suggestions are welcome. I tried to do the libft using 4 testers.
